# Connect4 X ZkNoid

"Connect4" is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is to connect four of your discs in a row â€” horizontally, vertically, or diagonally â€” before your opponent does. By integrating with ZkNoid, this version of Connect4 ensures secure, provable gameplay with gasless transactions, all powered by the Mina Protocol.

This project was built during the EthBangkok Hackathon to demonstrate the power of ZK (Zero-Knowledge) technology in enhancing trust, transparency, and seamless gaming experiences.

## What is ZkNoid?
